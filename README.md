ChristmasClock
==============

A little clock that plays a random Christmas song every hour, on the hour. 

Features include:
* Customizable color schemes
* Both 12 and 24-hour modes
* On-demand song playing
* Easily add your own songs
* Position persistence

Future Plans
==============
ChristmasClock is basically complete as there are no bugs that I know of and there aren't really any other features that I want to implement. The only features I can think of is an auto updater and the ability to pull songs from a centralized server. However, these seem like more trouble than it's worth for a little side project that was originally a gift, especially since there really isn't anyone using it anyway, including me. That being said, if this gains any degree of popularity, I will reconsider. If someone wants to try their hand at making these or any other additions, by all means fork, modify, and send a pull request.

License
==============
While this is currently not released under any license, it will probably be released under the GNU GPL v3 license at some point.
